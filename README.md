# README: Christmas Tree and Snowman HTML/CSS Project

## Overview

This project creates a festive web page featuring a **Christmas Tree** and a **Snowman** using HTML and CSS. It showcases the use of CSS styles for creative graphical elements and is perfect for learning how to combine shapes, gradients, and animations for a fun holiday theme.

## Files

### 1. `index.html`
This file contains the HTML structure of the web page. The key components include:
- **Christmas Tree**: Made up of three triangular sections, a rectangular trunk, and glowing ornaments.
- **Snowman**: Created using CSS gradients and radial/linear gradient layers for realistic effects.

### 2. `style.css`
This file contains the styling and layout for the elements in `index.html`. It is responsible for:
- The background design.
- Styling for the Christmas Tree and its ornaments.
- Detailed layer styling for the Snowman.

## Key Features

### Christmas Tree
- Constructed using CSS triangles (`border-style: solid`).
- Three layers of green triangles with shadows to create a 3D effect.
- A trunk at the bottom styled as a rectangle.
- Five ornaments styled as glowing spheres with CSS `box-shadow` for festive lighting.

### Snowman
- Made with **radial gradients** for a smooth circular appearance.
- Details like eyes, buttons, and a carrot nose are implemented using additional radial and linear gradients.
- Layers of gradients simulate depth and realism.

## Code Explanation

### HTML
The HTML structure organizes the tree and snowman elements into separate containers:
- `<div class="christmas-tree">` for the tree and its ornaments.
- `<div id="snowman">` for the snowman, which relies entirely on CSS for its design.

### CSS
#### Christmas Tree
- **Triangles**: Achieved using `border-style: solid` and adjusting `border-width` to form a triangle shape.
- **Ornaments**: Styled with `border-radius: 50%` for circular shapes and glowing effects using `box-shadow`.

#### Snowman
- **Body**: Created using multiple radial gradients stacked on each other.
- **Features**: Eyes, buttons, and a nose are additional gradients positioned with `background-position`.
- **Hat and Scarf**: Linear gradients and precise positioning simulate these accessories.
